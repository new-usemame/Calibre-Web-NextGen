"""Acceptance tests for the two findings of the fourth adversarial review of
"Share my place" PR 3a (state/kindle-kids/legs/share-place-pr3/REVIEW-sol-4.md,
reviewed at f7b498257).

Spec: state/kindle-kids/specs/2026-10-11-share-my-place.md, sections 3, 11
and 12. A report is ordered by its effective time (its client clock, or its
receipt when that clock is too fast) and then by its actual receipt.

1. Receipt ties and existing rows.
   * An honest own report in the same client second as the shared one, but
     received later, wins at turn-on: no nudge, GET serves it, sync sends
     no older shared state.
   * Two reports with the same trusted (slightly fast) client clock: the
     later receipt wins, for place and for status, in the journal and for a
     checked Kobo reading the shared place.
   * A journal row written with the switch off, carrying a day-fast clock:
     once the switch is on, an honest newer report wins.
2. A checked PUT that loses the shared bookmark write to a concurrent legacy
   writer changes nothing else: the legacy day-fast status and statistics
   clocks stay as they were, so a later stale Reading does not erase
   Finished. The concurrent writer commits between the checked request's
   reads and its first update of the reading graph (scheduled at that
   update, over a WAL
   file database). The control runs the same schedule with no legacy clock
   normalization at all.
3. KOSync's journal (PR 2) keeps the status observation as one time, so a
   status tie has no receipt to break it (spec section 13). An unchecked,
   identified KOReader pushes two reports in the same client second,
   reading then finished: the later receipt wins, and the library listing
   serves finished.
