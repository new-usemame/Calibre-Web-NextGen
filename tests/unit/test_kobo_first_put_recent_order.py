""""Recently read" order around the first-PUT clock fix.

Spec: state/kindle-kids/specs/2026-10-11-share-my-place.md, section 12
("First-Kobo-PUT stamp bug"), with the decided Recent-sort rule: a Kobo
position's activity is the later of its device clock and its server receipt
(``max(last_modified, COALESCE(server_modified_at, last_modified))``). The
upgrade backfills each legacy receipt as ``min(clock, upgrade time)``, so on
rows that existed before the upgrade the order is exactly today's.

* Across the upgrade: an existing library's Recent order is the same before
  and after the receipt column is added and backfilled, including a legacy
  Kobo clock a little in the future.
* A Kobo whose clock runs a few seconds slow making the first report for a
  book: that book is the newest activity (its receipt is now), above a
  KOReader sync received just before it; and a first report of Finished
  lands in ReadBook.

Runs with the Share my place switch off: this fix is not behind it.
